      <h3>Rules of the Game</h3>
      <p>
        The game is played with three possible actions - rock, paper, and
        scissors - one of which is selected by each player.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Rock wins against Scissors</li>
        <li>Paper wins against Rock</li>
        <li>Scissors wins against Paper</li>
        <li>
          If both players select the same action, it is considered a tie, and
          play resumes until there is a clear winner.
        </li>
      </ol>
